Number Plate Recognition is a computer system that recognizes any digital image automatically on the number plate. This system includes various operations like taking pictures, localizing the number pad, truncating characters and OCR from alphanumeric characters. The main purpose of this system is to design and develop effective image processing techniques and algorithms to localize the license plate in the captured image, to divide the characters from the number plate and also to identify each character of the segment by using the Open Computer Vision Library. A rear image of the vehicleâ€™s number plate is captured and processed using various algorithms.
